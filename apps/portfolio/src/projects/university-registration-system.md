This project is a Java-based application designed to streamline the course registration process for a university with over 1000 students.

## Key Features

- **Efficient Registration:** The system provides an efficient way for students to track courses and register for them.
- **High Scalability:** It is designed to handle the load of over 1000 students attempting to register.
- **Concurrency:** The application uses concurrent programming techniques to allow multiple students to register for courses simultaneously, which is crucial for handling peak registration periods.
- **Performance Improvement:** The use of concurrency increased the system's throughput by up to 50% compared to a sequential approach.

## Technical Implementation

The application is built entirely in **Java**, with a focus on **concurrent programming** to handle multiple simultaneous user requests efficiently and prevent race conditions during the registration process. This demonstrates a strong understanding of multi-threading and performance optimization in a server-side application.
