StocksEye is a web application designed to track stock prices and provide real-time updates to users. *(Note: This project is currently under development.)*

## Key Features

- **Real-time Price Updates:** The application integrates with a financial data provider's API to fetch and display live stock prices.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** It uses Chart.js to create interactive charts, allowing users to visualize stock performance over time.
- **Modern Frontend:** The user interface is built with React.js, creating a responsive and dynamic single-page application.

## Technical Implementation

- **Frontend:** The application is developed using **React.js** for the UI components and state management, and **Chart.js** for rendering financial charts.
- **API Integration:** It communicates with an external financial data API to retrieve real-time and historical stock data.
