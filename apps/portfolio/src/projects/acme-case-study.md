This project is a sales forecasting and optimization platform for Acme. It leverages a synthetic dataset that models Acme’s hierarchical structure—Portfolio, Geography, Category, Brand, and Segment—with realistic market constraints at each level.

## Key Features

- **Sales Forecasting & Optimization:** The core of the platform is its ability to predict future sales and optimize for various business goals.
- **Hierarchical Data Modeling:** It uses a synthetic dataset that accurately reflects Acme's complex structure, including Portfolio, Geography, Category, Brand, and Segment.
- **Multi-Scenario Analysis:** The algorithm can run multiple scenarios, such as maximizing sales, maximizing margins, or achieving specific targets, allowing for flexible strategic planning.
- **Long-Term Projections:** The platform projects outcomes over a five-year period, providing a long-term view for decision-making.
- **Actionable Insights:** The structured output provides clear, actionable insights to help leadership set realistic growth expectations and strategic priorities.

## Technical Implementation

The project is built using Python and a suite of data science libraries.

- **Pandas and NumPy** are used for data manipulation and numerical calculations.
- **SciPy and Pulp** are used for the optimization algorithms.
- **Matplotlib** is used for generating visualizations of the forecasts and scenarios.
