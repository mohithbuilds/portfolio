This project focuses on low-level hardware and assembly language concepts, implemented in C. It involves the design and implementation of functions to manipulate the fields of instructions for the "MAD Raisin" processor.

## Key Features

- **Instruction Manipulation:** The project includes over 10 functions that use bitwise operators and bit masking to extract and manipulate specific fields from processor instructions.
- **Program Disassembly:** Key functions were developed to load a program into memory and then disassemble it, translating the machine code back into a human-readable format.
- **Hardware & Assembly Concepts:** The project was instrumental in increasing the understanding of fundamental hardware and assembly language principles.

## Technical Implementation

The project was coded entirely in **C**, running in a MobaXterm environment. It demonstrates a strong proficiency in low-level systems programming, including:

- **Bitwise Operations:** Extensive use of bit operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`) for precise data manipulation.
- **Memory Management:** Concepts of loading programs into memory.
- **Data Structures:** Using C structs to represent instruction formats.
