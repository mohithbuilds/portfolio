This project uses R to analyze global account ownership data, exploring trends and drawing conclusions based on demographics like gender, country, and education level.

## Key Features

- **Gender-Based Analysis:** The project investigates the differences in account ownership between genders across various countries.
- **Country-Specific Trends:** It explores and visualizes trends in key countries, including Brazil, India, and the United States.
- **Education Level Correlation:** The analysis examines the correlation between account ownership percentages and education levels (primary vs. secondary and higher).
- **Statistical Insights:** The project involves conducting statistical analysis to draw meaningful conclusions about global financial inclusion.

## Technical Implementation

The entire analysis was performed using R and R Notebooks.
- **R** was used for statistical calculations and data manipulation.
- **R Notebooks** provided an interactive environment for combining code, visualizations, and narrative text to present the findings in a clear and reproducible manner.
