# Portfolio Website

This portfolio website represents a transition from traditional CMS solutions to a markdown-based content management approach. Built with modern web technologies, it showcases a clean, performant, and maintainable architecture.

## Key Features

- **Markdown-based Content**: All content is stored in markdown files, making it easy to version control and edit
- **Modern Framework**: Built with SvelteKit for optimal performance and developer experience
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout that works across all device sizes
- **Dark Mode Support**: Built-in theme switching with system preference detection

## Technical Implementation

The website is built using SvelteKit with TypeScript for type safety. Tailwind CSS provides utility-first styling, while Drizzle ORM handles database interactions for features like post likes and comments.

The transition from Sanity CMS to markdown files simplifies the content management workflow while maintaining all the benefits of structured content.
