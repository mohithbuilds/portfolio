This project is a Python program that simulates the functionality of a modified ribosome, which builds amino acid chains from RNA sequences.

## Key Features

- **Ribosome Simulation:** The core of the program is a simulation of a ribosome that can translate RNA into amino acid chains.
- **Special Commands:** It implements five special commands (START, STOP, DEL, EXCHANGE, and SWAP) that allow for direct manipulation of the protein building process, going beyond standard biological processes.
- **File-based Configuration:** The simulation is highly configurable, reading codon mappings and evaluation orders from external files.
- **RNA Processing:** The program includes functions to encode RNA sequences, decode them into amino acid chains, and operate on them based on the defined evaluation rules.
- **Efficient Data Handling:** It utilizes appropriate data structures to store codon mappings and evaluation orders, ensuring efficient processing of the biological data.

## Technical Implementation

The project is developed entirely in **Python**. It showcases skills in file I/O, custom data parsing, and the implementation of complex, rule-based logic to simulate a biological process. The use of specific data structures for efficiency is also a key technical aspect.
