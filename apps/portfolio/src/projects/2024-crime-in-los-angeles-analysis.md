This project provides an in-depth analysis of the 2024 crime data from Los Angeles to uncover trends, correlations, and predictive insights.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Data Analysis:** The project explores the relationships between crime occurrences, victim demographics (age, gender, descent), and location.
- **Statistical Methods:** It employs statistical techniques like Chi-Squared tests and ANOVA to validate correlations and findings.
- **Predictive Modeling:** A Logistic Regression model is used to predict victim gender based on other crime-related factors.
- **Risk Identification:** The analysis identifies high-risk areas and specific times, providing valuable information for law enforcement and community safety initiatives.
- **Actionable Insights:** The ultimate goal is to provide clear, data-driven insights that can be used to develop strategies for improving public safety.

## Technical Implementation

The analysis was conducted using Python and popular data science libraries:
- **Pandas and NumPy** for data manipulation and cleaning.
- **SciPy** for statistical analysis.
- **Scikit-learn** for building and evaluating the Logistic Regression model.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn** for data visualization to illustrate trends and findings.
