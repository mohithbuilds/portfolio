			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>
				Hi, I'm Mohith, a Software Development Engineer passionate about building scalable, reliable, and data-intensive systems.
				I earned my B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Maryland, College Park, where I specialized in Machine Learning
				and minored in Entrepreneurial Leadership. My foundation in systems programming and data analysis helps me bridge backend engineering
				with the computational and architectural depth required to design performant and highly available systems.
			</p>
			<p>
				I code with purpose, writing efficient and maintainable code guided by strong design principles and a focus on real business impact.
				Guided by a <strong>Day 1 mindset</strong> and the philosophy of <strong>Kaizen</strong>, I continuously refine my systems and skills
				to deliver measurable and long-term impact.
			</p>
